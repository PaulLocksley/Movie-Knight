# Movie Knight - Group Letterboxd Analysis


## Comparisons

## Graphs


## Recommendations 
Movie Knight includes a very basic recommendation model, it takes similar films from the group that are rated highly and presents the most common options. 

I did try generating these dynamically with neural net recommendations but they were too expensive to run, if you have any cheap ideas please let me kow.
